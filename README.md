# DWFE11 - Sprint 04 SprintProject // DevsUnited

This is the 4th sprint project (the last one!) from Acamica's DWFE11 group. It consists in a Tweeter-like app.

Made with React/HTML/CSS/JS tecnologies and implementing Firebase as a DB solution, it allows users to login with Google Account or personal email and password, and send Tweets, sharing with others and stay in touch.

Currently in development.
